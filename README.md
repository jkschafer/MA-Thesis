# MA-Thesis
This project roughly follows my MA thesis research exploring the evolutionary pathways to BMR variation in primates. 
The data used comes from Isler et al., 2008 and the phylogeny is from the 10K trees project (Arnold et al., 2010). 
The statistical analyses follow a phylogenetic path analysis as proposed by Hardenberg &amp; Gonzalez-Voyer (2014).
